# Price Model deployed on GCP using Docker

This project consists in a very basic (and pretty inaccurate) Linear Regression using the [Asaniczka. (2023). USA Optimal Product Price Prediction Dataset [Data set]. Kaggle. https://doi.org/10.34740/KAGGLE/DS/3893031](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/usa-optimal-product-price-prediction/data) dataset, which is deployed in GCP using Docker.

It showcases my skills in building Docker images, registering them in a Cloud platfom (Google Artifact Registry), and deploying a Gradio app in Google Cloud Run.
